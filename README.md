This is a collaborative effort. To develop this website, we used HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.
The project is based on the cafe and restaurant Farm To Table in Vesu, Surat, Gujarat. This project was built as part of the Google Winter Of Code (GWOC) programme, which was organised by GDSC and SVNIT Surat.
